# Idk Calculator

A tiny touchscreen-friendly calculator that intentionally always responds with the same answer.

Open `/home/Jagman/Documents/Calculator/index.html` in a browser or serve the folder and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

Quick local serve (from the Calculator folder):

```bash
cd /home/Jagman/Documents/Calculator
python3 -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
